The code for my Chatbot is in app1.py.
The scraped data is in document.txt.

How to run the chatbot locally?
Just save both app1.py and document.txt in a folder in your device.
Open that folder in VS Code or any other compiler.
Run app1.py.
On terminal write " streamlit run app1.py ". where app1.py is the name of the file in which you will store the code for this chatbot.
Press Enter.
It will take you to "http://localhost:8501/".
Write a question in the given question box and press Enter.
