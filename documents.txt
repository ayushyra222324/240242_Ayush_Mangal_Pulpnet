Study Tips: Students often, either because of personal reasons or involvement in extra curricular activities or lack of motiviation, do not want to gear up too early, but let us tell you that leaving preparation for too late is an excellent recipe for stress. Regularly attending the classes and being in touch with the course material is a good idea. It not only helps you prepare better for the exams but also keeps you interested in the course.Know YourselfDifferent students have different ways of studying. Some are able to perform and understand better by covering current subjects in small amounts on a regular basis in accordance with class, while some others find it convenient to study in bulk say at the end of the week or so. You should try figure out which way suits you better. In case you can not come to a conclusion, we suggest you to follow the first approach of studying in small amounts on a regular basis. Identify Best Time for Studying: Everyone has high and low periods of attention and concentration. Figure out are you a morning person or a night person. Use your power times to study and the down times for routines. Write down what you have to do, when and then prioritize. Maintaining a schedule can make you feel more in control. Identify the place of study that suites you most, avoiding distractions, be it the library or the comfort of your room. You should constantly motivate yourself Reward yourself when you have achieved some goal. Try not to overburden yourself by unnecessarily comparing yourself with others.
---
Improving Concentration: Take regular, short breaks when you are working - for example, some students find it better to study for an hour or so and then relax for 10 mins. This helps to concentrate for longer. Rather than studying throughout the night in library without enough concentration, it’s better to focus your attention and study effectively for a shorter period of time.If you are finding it very difficult to concentrate, start off by setting yourself a small, manageable goal. When you have achieved this, give yourself some reward. Keep repeating this process. As you achieve your goals, gradually increase what you set out to do. In this way you can train yourself to concentrate more effectively. Improving Study Habits Improving the study habits also help in concentrating better. Here are a few tips: Make notes as you read. And list the important points that can be reviewed later. Speak out loud. Mix topics frequently. Mix easy and difficult topics, and interesting and dull topics. Seek help from the seniors who had already done that course, you can learn from their experience and their mistakes. Discuss your doubts with your friends, this will help you in better understanding the topic. If you still have doubts feel free to approach your instructor/tutor. Just mail them and ask for some suitable time to meet them. 
---
Self Confidence: Everyone in this class is smarter and faster than I am. I always mess up on quizzes. If I don't do well on this exam, then I'll getan F in the course. This is the worst course. Become aware of what you say to yourself. Try writing your negative thoughts and then disputing each one with a positive statement like Even if I am afraid, I will do everything I can to overcome any obstacle in order to achieve my goals Encourage yourself, as you would have done to a friend. Repeating your positive statements to yourself will help reprogram your mind for success instead of for failure. In case you still find it difficult to get rid of these thoughts or feelings please feel free to contact our counsellors who might be able to help you better. Academic Help: IIT Kanpur is a premier academic institution and so, providing academic help forms an integral part of the work undertaken by the Institute Counselling Service. The ICS monitors the academic performance of students who are not able to meet their prescribed academic requirements. If you are facing any difficulty, you can always approach us for individual mentoring. For first year courses, you can also attend the remedial classes which are regularly conducted at the institute and hall level to help clarify doubts and concepts. 
---
Remedial Classes : We aim to try and solve problems faced by academically weaker students to help them cope with the academic system of the institute. Remedial classes are conducted and one to one mentoring is offered for these students. Remedial classes are conducted at regular intervals and on demand near quizzes/exams at institute level as well as hall level for 1st year and 2nd year courses. The aim of these classes, rather than to provide a parallel tutoring system, is to cover topics at a ground level so as to clear concepts and provide motivation for the topics being studied. These classes are held regularly during whole semester and help the student to perform better in their exams. Structure of classes are designed such that basic of the course contents can be easily understood. These classes are further sub-categorized into three 1.Institute level Remedial classes2. Hall Level Remedial Classes3.One to One mentoring. Institute Remedial Classes:Institute level Remedial classes are organized by the Institute Counselling Service in order to provide help in understanding courses and clearing doubts, if any. The main aim for organizing these classes are to clear common doubts in the course and to provide a platform for students to strengthen their basics. These classes aren't meant to be substitutes for regular lectures. It is highly recommended not to miss any lecture assuming that a remedial class will be held. Remedial classes do not cover all course content, and are conducted at a very slow pace. Hall Level Classes:Hall Level Classes are held in the respective halls(hostels). This initiative is taken in the under-graduate Halls of Residence to increase the student-mentor interaction. These classes are generally held a week before exams to help a student to clarify their common doubts and help them in solving tricky numerical problems. One To One

Mentoring:One-to-one mentoring is a means to address academic problems of students at an individual level, especially for those who aren't able to match other students' pace in a class and/or are hesitant to talk about problems that they are facing publicly.

Q&A from Lost to Found
I think I am a good listener. However, when someone expresses an opinion on a situation that is totally contrasting to me – I have this bias that this person is overthinking or thinking wrongly of the situation; and that results in expressing my opinion too – leading to a poor conversation. How do you, as a counselor, practice to keep your bias totally aside?You bring in a lot of self-awareness with your question. Counsellors’ education and training improve their communication skills and allow them to practice empathy along with maintaining their rationality. On a general level, learning assertive communication skills might be useful to maintain a good conversation. Using the given communication style, a person can learn to express their thoughts and feeling without coming across as too aggressive or too passive to others.

HowQ. to realize that we’re ‘worthy’ of it? How could one be ‘what you want to be’ retaining what ‘you originally are’?
Being worthy of a meaningful, happy, and satisfying life is the goal of human existence. Things/people/experiences which make you question your worth and your happiness need to be questioned themself. The second part of the question compares future ‘self’ with the present ‘self’. It relates to the underlying insecurities and fear which any life changes bring about. You can understand it in this way that the “5-year younger you” is not the same as “the present you”. In the same way, “the future you” will also be different. Although, you are one person, and what connects them is ‘being you.’ When you develop an awareness of ‘who I am’ as a person, then external changes will only be able to bring external effects, and internally it will be the same ‘you’ who has gone through these changes.

I have a wingie from a reserved category who has a very low CPI < 4 after the third semester. He is facing Academic Probation. He has lied to his parents about his CPI. He is currently participating in Galaxy(dance). He does not talk with anybody from the wing (from the beginning). What do you think should be done to help him? Do you think it is necessary for the counselling service or the Institute to prevent such people from participating in cultural events as their CPI is low? Or do you think something can be done to do the above-mentioned activities? Please give a realistic response.
Your question reflects a lot of concern and good intentions on your part. For your wingie, 1. Academic help can be provided to him through academic mentors or TAs. 2. As per the Institute policy, if a student is in 'Academic Probation' or 'Warning’, they can not hold any ' Position Of Responsibility'. 3. If a student does not want to take part in some hall level event/activity but is being forced by seniors or peers, one can inform his Student Guide, counsellor, Head of Counselling Service, DOSA, or Hall warden. He will be exempted from taking part in the event. However, if a person is extremely motivated to take part in some co-curricular activity and is unable to make the balance between academics and co-curricular activities, then he has to work on his 'Time Management' . Attending regular classes and a few hours of self-study may help him.

How do you overcome the feeling of loss of interest in doing basic routine daily life? How do you cope up with the constant thoughts of what shall I do to be happy in a depression period? How to cope with this if the person gets diagnosed with depression with anxiety and panic attacks behavioral problems? 
Losing interest in doing basic routine daily life is signs and symptoms of depression and with the help of psychological intervention, a person can improve their interest in doing things.  It is like a process to work on that to develop interest in daily activities in collaboration with the therapist and client. There is no specific way to be happy during a depression period. During that period a person goes through negative automatic thoughts about the self,future and sometimes about the world. So during this time a professional counselor or therapist can help a person to live in a normal way. If a person is diagnosed with depression it’s difficult for the person to cope up with the depression, but with the help of medication and psychotherapy and counseling a person with depression can cope up and lead a normal life.

The Institute Counselling Service has started a new initiative towards maintaining good mental health called “Samvad.” Under Samvad, we aim to organize various talks, panel discussions and related activities to spread mental health awareness.It is important for us to come together to prevent our friends from taking any untoward step. We often fail unwittingly, to lend a helping hand in their hour of distress, because more often than not, we are incapable of recognising the symptoms and hence are unable to provide the necessary support.It is also crucial for people to realise that they will find help, if only they would seek it. The aim of the panel discussion, “Holding on to the Light”, is to raise awareness about this issue and also to look for possible solutions. Because, in an inclusive society, suicide prevention is everyone’s responsibility.

What are some other scholarships which I can get apart from SBF?You can get Merit-cum-Means scholarship, Sports scholarship, various Donor Departmental scholarships, and Basic Mess & Pocket Allowance.
What is Counselling?Counselling is not the same as giving advice. It is quite different from the general opinion held by people. Going for a counselling session in no way indicates that you are helpless or incapable of solving your problems. By talking about your problems or concerns with a counsellor you will deepen your understanding of your problem and develop the means to deal with them. We are happy to talk over any of your problems and with your agreement may refer you to other sources who might be able to help better such as psychiatrists or doctors.
---
What will the counsellor think of me - will they think badly of me for getting into a mess?Many of our problems arise just because we are human.We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. No. Counselling is based in the belief that most people naturally strive to make the best use of themselves. When something goes wrong, it is usually because we are pushing ourselves too hard; because we are in a muddle for reasons we don't fully understand or because we are actually are suffering some form of mental distress which is distorting our view of reality. Therefore judging is not helpful or relevant; they need to be supported in finding their own way out of the problem.
---
How can it be right to be in need of help?We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. Needing help is a normal part of this process. You could only label it as failure if you had already decided you must succeed entirely on our own - which is not a burden you have to impose on yourself. If you think you've failed, the counsellor might help you see that this is not all there is to it.
---
Is counselling like psychiatry?Counselling bears little relation to psychiatry except that both deal with emotional and mental processes. Psychiatrist are trained doctors, who work largely through diagnosis of illness and then by prescribing a treatment - usually involving medication. Counsellors are normally non-medical personnel who work by talking and encouraging you to find your own solutions. Counsellors can however recognize the symptoms of severe mental distress, and may suggest you to consider medical help if seems appropriate.
